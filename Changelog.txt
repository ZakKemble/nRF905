2020-10-01:
	- Version 3.1.0
	- Added all callbacks example
	- Added some MCU autodetection for setting up the SPI pins
	- Added functions to individually set RX and TX payload sizes

2017-09-12:
	- Version 3
	- Simpified the library API
	- Now uses callbacks for when events occur (valid packet received, invalid packet received, address match, transmission complete).
	- Now uses Arduino interrupt handling when using the library in the Arduino environment
	- And various other things

2015-08-31:
	- Added ability to read config registers, mainly for debugging
	- Fixed issue with non-Arduino version where using a pin other than B2 for SPI SS wouldn't work

2014-01-20:
	- Tons of fixes, improvements, generally works much better

2013-01-18:
	- Removed ISR_NOBLOCK attribute from ISR

2013-01-20:
	- Bug fix: Destination and source were the wrong way round in memcpy()

2013-01-05:
	- Minor optimisation (~14bytes smaller, probably uses fewer CPU cycles)

2013-01-04:
	- Instead of disabling global interrupts when using SPI, just the pin change interrupt for DR is disabled.
	- Couldn't compile with interrupts disabled.
	- Putting module into receive mode was done in the wrong place in the non-arduino examples.

2013-01-01:
	- Initial release
